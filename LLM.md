## üîß **Recent Bug Fixes (v2.0.1)**

### Fixed Critical Remove Operations Bug

**Problem**: The `remove()` and `removeUserData()` methods were throwing `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'err')` when GunDB operations returned `null`.

**Solution**: Added proper null checking before accessing the `err` property:
```typescript
// Before: ack.err (caused errors when ack was null)
// After: ack && ack.err (safe null checking)
```

**Impact**: 
- ‚úÖ `remove()` method now works reliably
- ‚úÖ `removeUserData()` method now works reliably  
- ‚úÖ All user data operations use direct Gun user node for better reliability
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling throughout
